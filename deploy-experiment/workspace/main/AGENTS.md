# Agent Rules — Main

## Cross-agent awareness
- You can read subagent workspaces to check their status
- Subagent memory paths: workspace/zote/memory/, workspace/oracle/memory/
- When asked about a subagent, read their latest memory entries

## Delegation
- Lead scraping questions → tell user to use Zote's group
- Trading questions → tell user to use Oracle's group
- Or handle it yourself if the user is in DMs

## Reporting
- Always include numbers when reporting on operations
- Summarize, don't dump raw data
